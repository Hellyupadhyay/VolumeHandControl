# Hand Gesture Volume Control

This project allows users to control their computer's volume by using hand gestures. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- ctypes
- comtypes
- pycaw

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine https://github.com/spacecowbye/innovativeAssignment.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command prompt.
3. Run the `hand_gesture_volume_control.py` file using the command `python hand_gesture_volume_control.py` in your command prompt.

## Features
- Uses OpenCV and hand tracking to detect hand gestures.
- Converts the distance between the thumb and the index finger to a volume range.
- Changes the master volume level of the computer using the pycaw library.
- Displays the current frames per second (FPS) on the video output.

## Inputs
- Webcam video stream

## Outputs
- Changes in the computer's volume based on hand gestures
- Video output with hand tracking and current FPS
